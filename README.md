# PolyGone
A combinatorial game of disappearing polygons

**Starting position:** The game starts with an undirected graph having n>2 nodes and a finite number of cycles. 

**RULESET**

- Alternating play.
- Each player(on her turn) will select any cycle and remove it such that the number of closed polygons in the graph must decrease.
- The player who cannot reduce the number of polygons loses, i.e, the player on whose turn there is no closed cycle left to open will lose.
